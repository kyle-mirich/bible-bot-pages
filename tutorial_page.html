            <strong>Word for Word</strong> - a literal translation that adheres as closely as possible to the ancient text, translating each word into modern English.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Thought for Thought</strong> - a highly readable translation that focuses on conveying the original thought, idea, or concept, rather than translating each word literally. While still keeping places , names , and other hard facts the same. Finding a balance between scholarly precision and readability.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
        <strong>
            **Tip** - Give Bible Bot custom instruction to create your own unique translation tailored to you!
        </strong>
        For example 'Create a new translation of John 3 for a 7 year old' or ask ,  'Create a word for word translation of John 3:16 in Japenese at a 9th grade reading level'
