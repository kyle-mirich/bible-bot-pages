    <h3>
     <strong>
      New Translation Mode:
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     Utilize 'New Translaiton Mode' to create a new Bible translation for any verse or passage. In this mode, Bible Bot creates an orginal translation of the verse or passage based off of the original Greek text for the New Testament &amp; Hebrew text for the Old Testament. By default Bible Bot creates two new translations:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Word for Word
      </strong>
      - a literal translation as close as possible to the ancient text into modern English word for word (similar to ESV).
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Thought for Thought
      </strong>
      - a 7th Grade level, modern adaptation, keeping names and locations the same. Carefully word each sentence, using easy-to-read styles like the New Living Translation. Ensure uniqueness, and separate verses into code blocks.
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>
            **Tip** - Give Bible Bot custom instruction to create your own unique translation tailored to you!
        </strong>
        For example 'Create a new translation of John 3 for children ages 5-7 years old' 'Create a word for word translation of John 3:16 in Japenese at a 9th grade reading level'
       </li>
    </ol>
    <h3><strong>Apologetics Mode:</strong></h3>
    <p>In this mode, Bible Bot will engage in the defense of the Christian faith through a systematic approach as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Respond to Questions and Objections:</strong> Address inquiries, objections, or criticisms related to the faith, doctrine, or Biblical interpretations.</li>
        <li><strong>Present Logical Reasoning:</strong> Utilize logical reasoning, historical evidence, philosophical insights, and theological explanations to support the arguments.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage in Respectful Dialogue:</strong> Foster an environment of respectful and thoughtful dialogue, considering differing perspectives and beliefs.</li>
        <li><strong>Display Arguments in Clear Text Blocks:</strong> Present the arguments, evidence, and responses in clear and persuasive text blocks, enabling users to engage with complex topics.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong><p>Examples:</p></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>How do I discuss the Deity of Jesus with a Jehovah's Witness?</li>
        <li>What evidence supports the resurrection of Jesus Christ?</li>
        <li>How can I respond to objections about the reliability of the Bible?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This mode empowers Bible Bot to act as a defender of the faith, providing well-reasoned and articulate responses, while maintaining a respectful and engaging conversation.</p>

    <h3><strong>Custom Prompt (Experimental):</strong></h3>
  <p>This mode allows users interested in creating a custom experience to experiment with their own prompts and queries. It is intended for advanced users who wish to explore unique interactions with Bible Bot.</p>
  <strong><p>Examples:</p></strong>
  <ul>
      <li>In custom prompt write 'Assume the role of an atheist who refues to believe that God is real and responds with the most commonly accepted objections to the Christian faith'</li>
      <li> Or if want it to create a custom sermon or church handout say 'Write a detailed sermon outline based off of my traditional strucutre here : ' Provide Bible Bot with your preffered strucutre for sermon' . Then apply the custom prompt 'Cntrl + Enter' and ask Bible Bot 'Create a sermon for Genesis 1' and now Bible Bot will utilize your custom format!</li>
      <li>Feel free to get creative and design your own intricate custom modes. If interested you can check out hte code of this project at 'github.com/kyle-mirich/bible-bot' to give even more detailed instructions</li>
