<h2>History of the Seventh Day Adventist Church

<b>1. Millerites:<b> The history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is deeply rooted in the Millerite movement, which began in the early 19th century. The Millerites were followers of William Miller, a Baptist preacher from the United States.

- <b>William Miller:<b> William Miller, born in 1782, became convinced through his study of the Bible that he could predict the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. He believed that through a careful examination of prophetic texts, particularly in the books of Daniel and Revelation, he could determine the date of Christ's return.

- <b>The Great Anticipation:<b> Miller's central message was that Jesus would return to Earth in the near future. He initially calculated the date for the Second Coming as March 21, 1843, and later revised it to October 22, 1844. Miller's predictions gained a significant following, and his message spread rapidly across various parts of the United States.

- <b>The Millerite Movement:<b> Miller's teachings led to the formation of the Millerite movement, with thousands of believers who fervently anticipated the imminent return of Christ. Millerite preachers traveled extensively, holding large gatherings and sharing the message of the approaching Second Advent.

- <b>The "Great Disappointment":<b> October 22, 1844, became the focal point of Millerite expectations, with thousands of believers gathered in anticipation of Christ's return. However, the predicted event did not occur, leading to profound disappointment among Millerites. This event came to be known as the "Great Disappointment."

- <b>Consequences:<b> The Great Disappointment was a significant crisis for the Millerite movement. Many followers had given up their possessions, jobs, and personal relationships in anticipation of the Second Coming. The failure of the prediction led to a period of disillusionment and confusion within the movement.

- <b>Post-Disappointment Developments:<b> While the Great Disappointment was a setback, it did not mark the end of the story. Some Millerites continued to search for answers and reevaluate their beliefs. It was during this period of introspection and reexamination that the foundations of what would become the Seventh-day Adventist Church were laid.

The Millerite movement, with its fervent anticipation of the Second Coming and the subsequent Great Disappointment, played a crucial role in shaping the beliefs and religious identity of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It was within this historical context that the seeds of Adventism were sown, ultimately leading to the emergence of a distinct religious denomination.

<b>2. The "Little Flock":<b> Following the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844, a small group of dedicated Millerite believers, often referred to as the "Little Flock," embarked on a journey of spiritual reevaluation. In the wake of the disappointment, this period of reflection and study would profoundly shape the foundation of what would eventually become the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

- <b>Joseph Bates, the Financial Backbone:<b> Among the prominent figures within the Little Flock was Joseph Bates. Unlike many others who were relatively young in age, Joseph Bates was an older and experienced leader. Importantly, Bates played a pivotal role as the financial backbone of the movement. His financial support and practical contributions were instrumental in sustaining the group's activities and outreach efforts during a time when many others were relatively youthful and less financially stable.

- <b>Ellen G. White:<b> Another influential figure among the Little Flock was Ellen G. White (nÃ©e Harmon'>. Ellen G. White would go on to become a central and influential leader in the development of Seventh-day Adventism. Widely regarded as a prophetess within the Seventh-day Adventist community, her prolific writing ministry spanned many decades. Through her extensive writings, which included books, articles, and letters, Ellen G. White provided invaluable guidance and doctrinal insights that would shape the emerging Adventist movement.

- <b>Sabbatarian Beliefs:<b> During this period, members of the Little Flock began to recognize the significance of observing the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday'> as a central component of their faith. They firmly believed that the Sabbath was a vital element of biblical truth and that its observance was essential for faithful Christian living.

- <b>Doctrinal Development:<b> The Little Flock engaged in rigorous biblical study, leading to the formulation of distinctive doctrines that would become foundational to Seventh-day Adventism. These doctrines encompassed beliefs related to the heavenly sanctuary, the investigative judgment, the enduring relevance of the Ten Commandments, and a strong emphasis on health reform and healthy lifestyle choices.

- <b>Formative Years:<b> As this group of believers continued to refine their comprehension of Scripture and develop a unique set of beliefs, they laid the groundwork for what would evolve into the organized Seventh-day Adventist Church. These formative years were marked by a steadfast commitment to biblical study, fervent prayer, and a profound sense of prophetic mission.

- <b>Organization and Growth:<b> In 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was officially organized, with Ellen G. White, Joseph Bates, and other leaders playing central roles in shaping its structure and beliefs. Ellen G. White's prophetic ministry provided spiritual guidance, while Joseph Bates' financial contributions and leadership bolstered the movement, helping to establish a clear sense of identity and mission.

The emergence of the "Little Flock" was not only characterized by Ellen G. White's spiritual leadership but also highlighted the pivotal role of Joseph Bates as the financial backbone, ensuring the movement's sustainability and growth during a time when many others were relatively young and financially dependent. Together, they laid the doctrinal and organizational foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which would go on to become a distinctive and globally influential denomination.

<b>3. Emergence of Seventh-day Adventism:<b> The emergence of the Seventh-day Adventist Church can be traced back to the aftermath of the "Great Disappointment" and the formative years of the "Little Flock." During this period, a distinctive set of beliefs and practices began to take shape, eventually leading to the formal organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

- <b>Doctrinal Distinctives:<b> The members of the "Little Flock" engaged in intensive biblical study and theological reflection. They believed that while the specific date of Christ's return was not as predicted by William Miller, the event itself had significant prophetic implications. This led to the development of a unique set of doctrines, which included:

- <b>The Seventh-day Sabbath:<b> One of the most distinctive beliefs of Seventh-day Adventism is the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday'> as the biblical day of rest and worship.

- <b>The Investigative Judgment:<b> Adventists believe that in 1844, Christ entered into a phase of His high priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, conducting an investigative judgment of professed believers.

- <b>The Sanctuary Doctrine:<b> Central to Adventist theology is the belief in a heavenly sanctuary, where Christ's ministry on behalf of humanity is taking place.

- <b>The Perpetuity of the Ten Commandments:<b> Adventists teach that the moral law, including the Ten Commandments, is still binding and relevant for Christians today.

- <b>Health Reform:<b> Another distinctive aspect of Seventh-day Adventism is its emphasis on health reform. Adventists advocate for a vegetarian diet, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and other healthful practices.

- <b>Prophetic Identity:<b> The Adventist movement embraced a sense of prophetic identity, believing that they were part of God's end-time remnant with a special mission to prepare the world for the second coming of Christ.

- <b>Formal Organization:<b> In 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was officially organized during a general conference held in Battle Creek, Michigan. This marked the formal establishment of the denomination with an organized structure, a statement of beliefs, and a sense of mission.

- <b>Leadership of Ellen G. White:<b> Ellen G. White, often referred to as a prophetess, played a pivotal role in the early development of Seventh-day Adventism. Her extensive writings provided guidance and doctrinal insights, helping to shape the church's beliefs and practices.

The emergence of Seventh-day Adventism was marked by a commitment to distinct theological beliefs, a focus on health reform, a sense of prophetic identity, and the organizational establishment of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This period of theological development and organization laid the foundation for the growth and global impact of the denomination.

<b>6. Evolution of Doctrine in the Last 100 Years:<b> Over the past century, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has seen some evolution and refinement of its doctrinal positions. While the core beliefs have remained consistent, there have been nuanced changes and developments in understanding.

- <b>Doctrinal Clarity:<b> The early 20th century saw efforts to clarify and define certain doctrinal positions.

<h2>God's Command: Testing Prophets
Throughout the pages of Scripture, God has entrusted His people with a solemn responsibility: to test and discern the authenticity of prophets and their messages. This divine command is rooted in the recognition that not all who claim to speak in the name of the Lord are genuine bearers of His message. As faithful followers of God, we are called to exercise discernment, diligently evaluating the claims and prophecies of those who profess to be His mouthpieces. It is by following this directive that we can ascertain whether these prophetic utterances truly emanate from the Lord or carry a different origin altogether. Let us delve into the sacred verses of the Bible that illuminate this vital command and its significance in guiding our faith.

<h2>The Biblical Tests for Discerning True Prophets

In the Bible, God has provided clear guidelines for testing and discerning true prophets from false ones. These tests are essential to ensure that the messages proclaimed truly originate from the Lord. Let us explore some key verses that illuminate these tests:

- <b>Deuteronomy 18:22 (ESV'>:<b> "When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the Lord has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him."

- <b>1 John 4:1 (ESV'>:<b> "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world."

- <b>Matthew 24:24 (ESV'>:<b> "For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect."

- <b>Jeremiah 28:9 (ESV'>:<b> "As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the Lord has truly sent the prophet."

These biblical tests serve as a guide for believers to navigate the claims of prophets and ensure that they are aligned with the will of God.


<h2>The Test of : Ellen G: White 

#<h3>Rubric
The criteria for evaluating prophets, as outlined below, are based on the "Fundamental Beliefs" of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (2015 edition, page 259'>:

1. <b>Scriptural Consistency:<b>
   - <b>Criteria:<b> Does the message agree with the Bible?
   - <b>Biblical Reference:<b> Isaiah 8:20

2. <b>Doctrinal Harmony:<b>
   - <b>Criteria:<b> A later prophet must not contradict earlier prophets; the Holy Spirit never contradicts His previously given testimony, for God does not change like shifting shadows.
   - <b>Biblical Reference:<b> James 1:17

3. <b>Fulfillment of Predictions:<b>
   - <b>Criteria:<b> Do the predictions come true?
   - <b>Biblical Reference:<b> Deuteronomy 18:22

4. <b>Recognition of Christ's Incarnation:<b>
   - <b>Criteria:<b> Is Christ's incarnation recognized?
   - <b>Biblical Reference:<b> 1 John 4:2-3

5. <b>Fruit Inspection:<b>
   - <b>Criteria:<b> Does the prophet bear good or bad fruit?
   - <b>Biblical Reference:<b> Matthew 7:15-16

These criteria are used within the Seventh-day Adventist Church to assess the authenticity and reliability of prophetic messages and teachings in alignment with their core beliefs. They emphasize the importance of scriptural consistency, doctrinal harmony, fulfillment of predictions, acknowledgment of Christ's incarnation, and evaluating the overall impact and character of the prophet. These guidelines aim to ensure that prophetic messages are in accordance with both biblical principles and the church's established doctrines.

<h2>Other Considerations

<h3>1. Accuracy in Quoting

It is essential to clarify that all quotes presented here are accurate and found in the writings of Ellen G. White. They faithfully represent what she actually said and wrote. This fact establishes a common ground, acknowledging that she indeed made the statements we've quoted.

<h3>2. Consistency Matters

Agreeing with the Bible in one part of her writings doesn't excuse the contradictions found in other sections. Ellen G. White's repeated contradictions of herself and Scripture raise valid concerns about her claim to be a true prophet of the Bible. This inconsistency challenges her credibility as a reliable source of spiritual guidance.

<h3>3. The Context Debate

You may come across arguments that we've taken Ellen White's statements out of context. However, we've diligently provided full references with each quoted statement, enabling you to examine them in their complete context. We encourage you, the reader, to scrutinize these references closely to determine if the statements align with the broader context or if apologists have indeed taken them out of context.

<h3>4. Transparency Matters

Transparency and accountability are vital in this discussion. We have always published our names clearly as the authors of this document and on our respective websites. However, it's worth noting that Ellen White's apologists often refer to us as "D&D" to protect their identity. Their choice to remain anonymous may raise questions about the transparency of their work.

<h3>5. Clarity Over Complexity

In the process of rebuttal, apologists sometimes employ lengthy and convoluted arguments, which can be confusing. We, on the other hand, have presented facts concisely and clearly. If you ever need further clarification or more information, don't hesitate to reach out to us via email. Our goal is to provide you with straightforward and accurate insights.

<h3>6. Verify for Yourself

Ultimately, the truth should be discerned through your own investigation. Don't believe anything blindly, whether from us or anyone else. It's crucial to check the sources and facts for yourself. We encourage you to take an active role in examining the evidence, comparing it to Scripture, and forming your own conclusions about Ellen G. White's teachings and her alignment with the Bible.

<b>Acts 10:9-16 (ESV'><b> "The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. And there came a voice to him: 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' But Peter said, 'By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.' And the voice came to him again a second time, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'"

<i>Context:<i> Paul warns against submitting to human regulations and teachings that forbid certain foods. He highlights that these regulations are of human origin and do not align with the freedom in Christ.

<b>Mark 7:18-19<b> "And he said to them, 'Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?' (Thus he declared all foods clean.'>"

<b>1 Corinthians 8:8<b> "Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do."

<i>Context:<i> Paul clarifies that one's dietary choices do not determine their standing before God. It is not what we eat but our faith in Christ that matters.

<b>1 Corinthians 10:25-26<b> "Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For 'the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.'"

<i>Context:<i> Paul encourages believers to eat whatever is sold in the meat market without questioning its source, recognizing that all things belong to the Lord.

<b>Against Ellen G. White's Dietary Teachings:<b> It's important to note that the idea of abstaining from meat and certain foods is primarily associated with the teachings of Ellen G. White, a prominent figure in the Seventh-day Adventist tradition. While her writings have had a significant influence on the dietary practices of some individuals and denominations, there is a lack of clear scriptural evidence to support these dietary restrictions. In fact, the Bible affirms the goodness of all foods created by God and the freedom believers have to enjoy them with gratitude. It is also worth noting that the dietary practices of Adam and Eve before sin (as mentioned in Romans 6:23'> are not prescriptive for Christians, as they were in a sinless state, and dietary regulations were introduced later in the biblical narrative.How could you kill an animal and eat it before death entered the world?  Therefore, the dietary restrictions attributed to Ellen G. White should be understood as a tradition within certain religious groups rather than a universally supported biblical doctrine.



<h2>50 Contradictions Summarized

"The SDA Church agrees that the cannon of the Bible closed 2000 years ago with the book of Revelation. They also tell us that Ellen White's writings are not an addition to the Bible but are just as inspired as the writers of the Bible. This concept, both in theory and practice makes EGW's writings equal to the Bible as far as the average Seventh-day Adventist is concerned.  By their accepting Ellen White as a prophetess and "Messenger of God", they unwittingly open the cannon of the Bible.  In this they are no different from other cults who likewise proclaim the prophet supremacy of their leader(s'>." - <a href='ELLEN G. WHITE CONTRADICTS the BIBLE

- EGW: SATAN - "It was seen, also, that while the sin offering pointed to Christ as a sacrifice, and the high priest represented Christ as a mediator, the scapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin, upon whom the sins of the truly penitent will finally be placed. ... Christ will place all these sins upon Satan, ... so Satan, ... will at last suffer the full penalty of sin" (Great Controversy, p. 422, 485, 486'>.

- BIBLE: JESUS - "He himself (Jesus Christ'> bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed" (1 Peter 2:24'>.

<b>29. Does God Require a Trespass Offering Before He Pardons Us?<b>

- EGW: YES - "You cannot make every case right, for some whom you have injured have gone into their graves, and the account stands registered against you. In these cases the best you can do is to bring a trespass offering to the altar of the Lord, and He will accept and pardon you" (Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 339'>.

<b>30. Can We Say We Are Saved Right Now by Christ's Grace?<b>

- EGW: NO - "Those who accept the Saviour, however sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or feel that they are saved. ... Those who accept Christ, and in their first confidence say, I am saved, are in danger of trusting to themselves" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 155'>.

- BIBLE: YES - "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life" (1 John 5:13'>.

<b>31. CAN THE FAITH OF BELIEVING PARENTS SAVE THEIR CHILDREN?<b>

- EGW: YES - "I know that some questioned whether the little children of even believing parents should be saved, because they have had no test of character and all must be tested and their character determined by trial. The question is asked, 'How can little children have this test and trial?' I answer that the faith of the believing parents covers the children" (Selected Messages, vol. 3, p. 313'>.

- BIBLE: NO - "If I bring a sword against that country ... and I kill its men and their animals, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men (Noah, Daniel and Job'> were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved. Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out My wrath upon it, ... even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness" (Ezekiel 14:17-20'>.

- BIBLE: NO - "The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him (Ezekiel 18:20'>.

<b>32. WILL THE SINS OF THE SLAVE BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SLAVE MASTER?<b>

<b>34. CAN WE LEGITIMATELY SAY "I HAVE CEASED TO SIN?"<b>

- EGW: YES - "Christ died to make it possible for you to cease to sin, and sin is the transgression of the law" (Review and Herald, vol. 71, No. 35, p. 1, August 28, 1894'>.

- EGW: YES - "To be redeemed means to cease from sin" (Review and Herald, vol. 77, No. 39, p. 1, September 25, 1900'>.

- EGW: YES - "Those only who through faith in Christ obey all of God's commandments will reach the condition of sinlessness in which Adam lived before his transgression. They testify to their love of Christ by obeying all his precepts" (Manuscript 122, 1901, quoted in the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1118'>.

- EGW: YES - "To every one who surrenders fully to God is given the privilege of living without sin, in obedience to the law of heaven. ... God requires of us perfect obedience. We are to purify ourselves, even as he is pure. By keeping his commandments, we are to reveal our love for the Supreme Ruler of the universe" (Review and Herald, September 27, 1906, p. 8'>.

- BIBLE: NO - "The blood of Jesus, his son, purifies us from all sin. If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives" (1 John 1:8, 9'>.

- BIBLE: NO - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8, 9'>.



<b>35. WILL OBEYING THE COMMANDMENTS EARN ME GOD'S FAVOR?<b>

- EGW: YES - "To obey the commandments of God is the only way to obtain (earn'> His favor" (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 28'>.
   - Ellen G. White asserts that obeying God's commandments is the sole means to earn God's favor.

- BIBLE: NO - "All our righteous acts are like filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6'>.
   - This Bible verse from Isaiah suggests that human righteous acts, including obeying commandments, are insufficient to earn God's favor and are compared to "filthy rags."

- BIBLE: NO - "Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by faith'" (Galatians 3:11'>.
   - The Bible verse from Galatians emphasizes that justification before God does not come through the law (obeying commandments'> but through faith.

So, the argument presents a contrast between Ellen G. White's belief that obeying God's commandments earns God's favor and the Bible's stance that human righteous acts, including obedience to the law, are insufficient for justification before God, and that faith plays a crucial role.
"""


<b>35. WILL OBEYING THE COMMANDMENTS EARN ME GOD'S FAVOR?<b>

<b>EGW:<b> "To obey the commandments of God is the only way to obtain (earn'> His favor" (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 28'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "All our righteous acts are like filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by faith'" (Galatians 3:11'>.

<b>Response:<b> Ellen G. White suggests that obeying the commandments is the way to earn God's favor. However, the Bible makes it clear that our own righteous acts cannot earn God's favor, and justification before God comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not by keeping the law. It's faith in Christ, not works, that saves us.

<b>36. DOES OUR OBEDIENCE AND FAITH RECONCILE US TO GOD?<b>

<b>EGW:<b> "Man, who has defaced the image of God in his soul by a corrupt life, cannot, by mere human effort, effect a radical change in himself. He must accept the provisions of the gospel; he must be reconciled to God through obedience to his law and faith in Jesus Christ" (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 294'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8, 9'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation" (Colossians 1:21, 22'>.

<b>Response:<b> Ellen G. White's view suggests that reconciliation to God depends on both obedience to the law and faith in Jesus Christ. In contrast, the Bible emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone, and it's not based on our works. Reconciliation with God is a result of Christ's work, not our own efforts.

<b>37. AS A CHRISTIAN DO I STILL STAND CONDEMNED BEFORE GOD?<b>

<b>EGW:<b> "At the time the light of health reform dawned upon us, and since that time, the questions have come home every day, 'Am I practicing true temperance in all things?' 'Is my diet such as will bring me in a position where I can accomplish the greatest amount of good?' If we cannot answer these questions in the affirmative, we stand condemned before God" (Counsels on Diet and Foods, pp. 19, 20'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned" (John 3:17, 18'>.

<b>BIBLE:<b> "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life" (John 5:24'>.

<b>Response:<b> Ellen G. White's statement suggests that our dietary choices can lead to condemnation before God. However, the Bible assures us that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Our salvation is based on faith in Christ, not on our dietary practices.


<b>39. DID JESUS ENTER THE MOST HOLY PLACE OF THE HEAVENLY TEMPLE BEFORE OCTOBER 22, 1844?<b>

<b>EGW: NO<b> - "I was shown that ... the door was opened in the most holy place in the heavenly sanctuary, where the ark is, in which are contained the ten commandments. This door was not opened until the mediation of Jesus was finished in the holy place of the sanctuary in 1844. Then Jesus rose up and shut the door of the holy place, and opened the door into the most holy, and passed within the second veil, where he now stands by the ark" (Early Writings, p. 42'>.

<b>BIBLE: YES<b> - "The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man" (Hebrews 8:1, 2 written in 60 AD'>.

<b>BIBLE: YES<b> - "He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption" (Hebrews 9:12 written in 60 AD'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Both these Bible texts were written in 60 A.D., and they both state Jesus was already ministering in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary at least 1,824 years before 1844. Ellen White's 1844 scenario simply contradicts the clearest Scriptures!

<b>40. ARE THE FORGIVEN SINS OF THE SAINTS NOT BLOTTED OUT UNTIL THE GREAT DAY OF FINAL AWARD?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "The blood of Christ, while it was to release the repentant sinner from the condemnation of the law, was not to cancel the sin; it would stand on record in the sanctuary until the final atonement. ... In the great day of final award, the dead are to be 'judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works' (Revelation 20:12'>. Then by virtue of the atoning blood of Christ, the sins of all the truly penitent will be blotted from the books of heaven" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 357'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more" (Hebrews 8:12'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more" (Isaiah 43:25'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more" (Jeremiah 31:34'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> The Bible is very certain that the moment God forgives our sins, they are forever removed, blotted out, canceled, and forgotten. First John 1:9 tells us that the instant we confess our sins, we receive God's forgiveness through His grace. By contradicting these Scriptures, EGW turns God's overwhelming mercy into a sham. God is recreated into a lying, malevolent, heavenly bookkeeper who manipulates Divine records to make it only appear that we are forgiven. For EGW, our forgiveness does not depend upon God's grace, but upon our "works."

<b>41. DID PAUL LEARN THE GOSPEL FROM MEN IN THE CHURCH?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "Paul must receive instruction in the Christian faith and move accordingly. Christ sends him to the very disciples whom he had been so bitterly persecuting, to learn of them. ... Now Paul was in a condition to learn of those whom God had ordained to teach the truth. Christ directs Paul to His chosen servants, thus placing him in connection with His church. The very men whom Paul was purposing to destroy were to be his instructors in the very religion that he had despised and persecuted" (Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 430'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "I want you to know, brothers, that the Gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. ... I did not consult any man, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus. Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days. I saw none of the other apostlesâonly James, the Lordâs brother" (Galatians 1:11-19'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> The Apostle Paul makes it clear that he received the Gospel directly from Jesus Christ through revelation and did not consult with any man or receive it from the disciples in Jerusalem. EGW's assertion contradicts Paul's own testimony about the source of his Gospel message.

<b>42. WHAT IS "THE SEAL OF GOD"?<b>

<b>EGW: SABBATH<b> - "The enemies of God's law, from the ministers down to the least among them, have a new conception of truth and duty. Too late they see that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living God" (Great Controversy, p. 640'>.

<b>BIBLE: HOLY SPIRIT<b> - "You were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit" (Ephesians 1:13'>.

<b>BIBLE: HOLY SPIRIT<b> - "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption" (Ephesians 4:30'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> This is a crucial contradiction. The Bible is certain that God's seal is the Holy Spirit. But EGW denies this Bible truth, claiming that the seventh day Sabbath is God's seal. Thus Sabbathkeeping is promoted as the great determiner of who is lost and who is saved. In this, EGW proclaims that it is the Sabbath which saves, rather than Jesus Christ who saves! This is heresy, claiming salvation by works. EGW makes the Sabbath the greatest commandment of all. James 2: tells if you offend in one point of the law (adultery, murder,'> you are guilty of all.

<b>43. ARE WE REQUIRED TO KNEEL EVERY TIME WE PRAY?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "Where have our brethren obtained the idea that they should stand upon their feet praying to God? One who has been educated about five years in Battle Creek was asked to lead in prayer before Sister White should speak to the people. But as I beheld him standing upright upon his feet while his lips were about to open in prayer to God, my soul was stirred within me to give him an open rebuke. Calling him by name, I said, 'Get down on your knees! This is the proper position always'" (Selected Messages, book 2, p. 311'>.

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "Both in public and private worship, it is our duty to bow down before God when we offer our petitions to Him" (Selected Messages, book 2, p. 311'>.

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "To bow down when in prayer to God is the proper attitude to occupy" (Selected Messages, book 2, p. 312'>.

<b>EGW: NO<b> - "We need not wait for an opportunity to kneel before God. We can pray and talk with the Lord wherever we may be" (Selected Messages, book 3, p. 266'>.

<b>EGW: NO<b> - "It is not always necessary to bow upon your knees in order to pray" (Selected Messages, book 3, p. 267'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God have mercy on me, a sinner'" (Luke 18:13'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins" (Mark 11:25'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's stance on kneeling in prayer appears contradictory, as she promotes both kneeling and not necessarily kneeling. The Bible does not prescribe a specific posture for prayer, and it is more concerned with the heart's attitude and sincerity in prayer.

<b>44. WILL PEOPLE BE LOST BECAUSE THEIR PASTOR IS UNTIDY?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "The loss of some souls at last will be traced to the untidiness of the minister" (Selected Messages, book 3, p. 25l'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "I will judge each of you according to his own ways" (Ezekiel 33:20'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him" (Ezekiel 18:20'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's assertion that some souls will be lost because of a pastor's untidiness contradicts the biblical principle that individuals are judged according to their own actions and not the actions of others.

---

<b>45. IS IT A SIN TO BE SICK?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "It is a sin to be sick; for all sickness is the result of transgression" (Counsels on Health, p. 37'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. ... In all this, Job did not sin" (Job 2:7, 10'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's assertion that all sickness is a result of transgression contradicts the biblical account of Job, who suffered from painful sores but did not sin.

<b>46. WILL GOD PREVENT THE WICKED FROM KILLING HIS PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO RECEIVE THE MARK OF THE BEAST?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "God would not suffer (allow'> the wicked to destroy those who were expecting translations and who would not bow to the decree of the beast or receive his mark. I saw that if the wicked were permitted to slay the saints, Satan and all his evil host and all who hate God, would be gratified. ... The swords that were raised to kill God's people broke and fell powerless as a straw. Angels of God shielded the saints" (Early Writings, pp. 284, 285'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years" (Revelation 20:4'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's vision of God preventing the wicked from killing His people who refuse the mark of the beast contradicts the biblical account in Revelation 20:4, where it is mentioned that some had been beheaded for their testimony for Jesus.

<b>47. DO THE WICKED TRY TO REPENT AS THEY EXPERIENCE THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "The plagues were falling upon the inhabitants of the earth. Some were denouncing God and cursing Him. Others rushed to the people of God and begged to be taught how they might escape His judgments (repentance'>. -- Those who had not prized God's Word were hurrying to and fro, wandering from sea to sea, and from the north to the east, to seek the Word of the Lord (repentance'>. ... What would they not give for one word of approval from God (repentance'>! But no, they must hunger and thirst on" (Early Writings, p. 28l'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify Him. ... Men gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done. ... and they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible" (Revelation 16:9-11, 21'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's vision of the wicked trying to repent during the seven last plagues contradicts the biblical account in Revelation 16:9-11 and 21, where it is stated that they cursed God and refused to repent.

<b>48. CAN SATAN ANSWER PRAYERS DIRECTED TO GOD?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "Satan appeared to be by the throne, trying to carry on the work of God. I saw them (Christians'> look up to the throne, and pray, 'Father, give us Thy Spirit.' Satan would then breathe upon them an unholy influence ..." (Early Writings, p. 56'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!" (Matthew 7:11'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven" (Matthew 18:19'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's assertion that Satan can answer prayers directed to God contradicts the biblical teaching that God, not Satan, answers the prayers of His faithful.

<b>49. WILL WE KNOW THE EXACT DAY AND HOUR OF CHRIST'S COMING?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "As God has shown me in holy vision ... we heard the voice of God like many waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus' coming" (Early Writings, pp. 15, 34, 285'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "Therefore, keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour" (Matthew 25:13'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority" (Acts 1:7'>.


<b>50. DOES JESUS RETURN TO EARTH AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "It was at midnight that God chose to deliver his people. As the wicked were mocking around them, suddenly the sun appeared, shining in his strength, and the moon stood still" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1, p. 205'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "Therefore, keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour" (Matthew 25:13'>.

<b>BIBLE: NO<b> - "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority" (Acts 1:7'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Ellen White's assertion that Jesus returns to earth at the stroke of midnight contradicts the biblical teaching that no one knows the day or the hour of Christ's return. It's important to note that her use of "midnight" appears to be symbolic and related to a miraculous event, not a specific time of Christ's return. The Bible emphasizes the unpredictability of the Second Coming.

<h2>ELLEN G. WHITEâS ADDITIONS TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

<b>1. DID SATAN REPENT AFTER HIS FALL?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "After Satan was shut out of heaven, with those who fell with him, he realized that he lost all the purity and glory of heaven forever. Then he repented and wished to be reinstated in heaven. He was willing to take his proper place, or any place that might be assigned him. ... He and his follower repented, wept and implored to be taken back into the favor of God. But no, their sin their hate, their envy and jealousy, had been so great that God could not blot it out. It must remain to receive its final punishment" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1, p. 18, 19'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. But, in Matthew 18:21-22, Jesus told Peter to forgive seventy times seven (490 times'>. If Ellen White was right, then it is strange that God expected more from Peter than He was willing to do Himself by refusing to forgive Satan! Wouldn't Christ have been willing to die in Satan's place -- had Satan repented? Is God really unmerciful and unforgiving?

<b>2. ADAM WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS TALL AS MEN TODAY.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "As Adam came forth from the hand of his Creator....He was more than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth....Eve was not quite as tall as Adam. Her head reached a little above his shoulders." (Spiritual Gifts, Vol. III p. 34'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. The Bible does not tell us the height of Adam and Eve, but Ellen does not leave us in doubt as to their height.

<b>3. IN THE FIRES OF HELL, DO THE WICKED FEEL PAIN AS LONG AS THERE IS ONE PIECE OF FLESH LEFT?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "I saw that some were quickly destroyed, while others suffered longer. ... Some were many days consuming, and just as long as there was a portion of them unconsumed, all the sense of suffering was there" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1, p. 217'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. What if their brain is consumed first; will they still feel pain? Can a finger feel pain after the rest of the body is destroyed? Where is a Bible text to support this error?

<b>4. DID JUDAS HAVE A CONVICTION TO CONFESS HIS SIN?<b>

<b>EGW: 1898 YES<b> - "When the Saviourâs hands were bathing those soiled feet, and wiping them with the towel, the heart of Judas thrilled through and through with the impulse then and there to confess his sin." (Desire of Ages p. 645'>.

<b>EGW: 1902 NO<b> - "As Christ celebrated this ordinance with His disciples, conviction came to the hearts of all save Judas." (Evangelism p. 275'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Mrs. White said yes in 1898 and God and Ellen changed their minds in 1902 and said no. This kind of inspiration is very hard to keep up with. I am thankful that the prophets of the Bible did not have this problem.

<b>5. WAS JOHN CAST INTO A CALDRON OF BOILING OIL BEFORE BEING BANISHED TO THE ISLE OF PATMOS?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - " John was cast into a caldron of boiling oil; but the Lord preserved the life of His faithful servant even as he preserved the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace. By the emperorâs decree John was banished to the Isle of Patmos" (Acts of the Apostles p. 570'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical: The miracles of life preservation have been recorded in Scripture to glorify God and to give us confidence in Godâs mercies. It seems strange that John chose not to glorify God with this miracle as Paul did when God delivered him and as recorded in Daniel of the fiery furnace and Daniel in the Lionâs den. If this miracle happened to me, being delivered from boiling oil, I would be shouting it from the housetops. It took God 2000 years to get this information to us by way of Ellen G. White. Why was it important for the Seventh-day Adventist Church to know about this miracle and not to have it recorded in Scripture for the encouragement of the Saints that went through persecutions? To believe this, one must have tremendous faith or be a deluded individual.

<b>6. THE HEROD MISTAKE AND COVER-UP.<b>

E. G. White was under the impression that the Herod that took part in Jesusâ trial was the same Herod that took the life of James. She did not realize that it was Herod Antipas who took part in Jesusâ trial and Herod Agrippa I who put James to death. This mistake was due to her ignorance of the Bible and Bible history.

Writing under inspiration; E. G. White wrote in 1858 that, "Herodâs heart grew still harder, and when he heard that JESUS had arisen, he was not much troubled. He took the life of James; and when he saw that this pleased the Jews, he took Peter also, intending to put him to death." (Spiritual Gifts Vol 1, p.71'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> The cover-up: This error was never corrected in the revisions of Early Writings. But when the error was discovered the authors tried to fix it by a footnote on page 185 of Early writings saying it was, "the same Herodian spirit only in another personality." Notice Ellen was talking under inspiration about an individual, Herod, not the spirit of an individual or their attributes. Jesus certainly knew the difference between the Herods and the reason Ellen did not, was that she was not inspired and did not have the gift of prophecy.

<b>7. JOHN THE BAPTIST KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO DIE.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "He knew that when Jesus should establish himself as a teacher, he must die" (Spiritual Gifts Vol. 1, p. 29'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. There is no Bible record of John knowing when he was going to die.

<b>8. MARY THE SISTER OF MARTHA AND LAZARUS, WAS MARY MAGDALENE, AND SHE WAS LED INTO SIN BY SIMON.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - The Feast At Simonsâ House. "Simon had led into sin the woman he now despised. "It was Mary who poured upon His head the precious anointing oil, and bathed His feet with her tears. Mary was first at the tomb after the resurrection." (Desire of Ages p. 566,568'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Mary, the sister of LAZARUS is never identified as Mary Magdalene, nor is it ever suggested from the Bible that Simon led Mary into sin and despised her.

<b>9. JESUSâ BROTHERS WERE OLDER THAN HE AND THEY WERE THE SONS OF JOSEPH AND SIDED WITH THE RABBIS.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "All this displeased His brothers. Being older than Jesus, they felt that He should be under their dictation. His brothers, as the sons of Joseph were called, sided with the rabbis. They insisted that the traditions must be heeded, as if they were the requirements of God." (Desire of Ages, p.86,87.'>

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. Ellen G. White adds to the Bible the same way that Joseph Smith does in the "Book of Mormon". How can Adventist claim that the Bible is the source of their faith and accept this as "the truth", and do it with a straight face?

<b>10. ANGELS NEED A GOLD CARD TO GET INTO AND OUT OF HEAVEN.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "All angels that are commissioned to visit earth hold a golden card, which they present to the angels at the gates of the city." (Early Writings p. 39'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. If this statement came from Joseph Smith would you accept it? No, because it is not found in the Bible. Then using the same principle for defining your faith how can you believe EGW's nonsense as truth? Does God who can number the hairs on our head, need a gold card to identify the angels? Why have angels at the gate when an ATM machine would work just as well?

<b>11. ELLEN G. WHITE THE ONLY PROPHET GIVEN WINGS WHILE IN VISION.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were given me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and glorious." (Early Writings p. 39'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. No Bible prophet was ever given wings at any time. Why were wings given to Ellen White in her vision? In vision they would not be necessary for travel. She certainly had a vivid imagination.

<b>12. MARRIAGES ARE TO BE DISCOURAGED.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - In 1885 EGW wrote, "In this age of the world, as the scenes of earthâs history are soon to close and we are about to enter upon the time of trouble such as never was, the fewer the marriages contracted, the better for all, both men and women." 5 Testimonies, p. 366.

<b>EGW: NO<b> - Also in 1885, "The time has come when, in one sense, they that have wives be as though they had none." (Ellen G. White, MS 34, The White Estate, 1885. Quoted in "Are Seventh-Day Adventists False Prophets?" p.29 by Wallace D. Slattery'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. To my knowledge Adventist Pastors today have not been discouraging any marriages. This is evident that they do not accept this teaching. The Bible was written for us and it does not ever discourage Christian marriages. The Bible does speak about marriage in the last days, calling those that forbid marriages, "liars."

<b>13. DO WE HAVE POWER IN OURSELVES?<b>

<b>EGW: NO<b> - 1862 "If Satan can so befog and deceive the human mind as to lead mortals to think that there is an inherent power in themselves to accomplish great and good works, they cease to rely upon God to do for them that which they think there is power in themselves to do" (1 Testimony, p. 294'>.

<b>EGW: YES<b> - 1870 "We all have a warfare before us, and must stand in a position to resist the temptations of Satan; and we want to know that we possess the power in ourselves to do this (Councils on Diet and Foods, p.169'>.

<b>14. IS TITHE PAYING A PRE-REQUISITE FOR PRAYING FOR THE SICK?<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "Prayer For the Sick Â¾ We should first find out if the sick one has been withholding tithes or has made trouble in the church" (Healthful Living, p. 237'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. This teaching would prohibit praying for sick non-Christian friends and relatives as well as Christians of other faiths that are sick that do not believe tithing is a requirement for the Christian Church. I could not find any example of Jesus or the Apostles checking on anyoneâs tithing performance before they healed them. I have never seen any Adventist Pastor follow Ellenâs ("inspired?"'> on this teaching. If you really believe that Ellen G. White is a prophetess then you will have to check and see if the sick is a tithe payer before you pray for them. Put your faith to the test, are you going to follow Jesus or Ellen?

<b>15. THE REDEEMED ARE TO FILL THE VACANCIES IN HEAVEN LEFT BY SATAN AND HIS ANGELS.<b>

<b>EGW: YES<b> - "The vacancies made in heaven by the fall of Satan and his angels will be filled by the redeemed of the Lord" (Watchman Nov. 78, 1905'>.

"It was Godâs purpose to repopulate Heaven with the human race, if after the test and trial they proved to be loyal to Him" (Signs of the Times, May 29, 1909'>.

<b>NOTE:<b> Not Biblical. The Bible never mentions that the redeemed will take the place of Satan and the fallen Angels nor does Scripture say that it is God's purpose to repopulate heaven with the human race. The Scripture does say that God is creating a New Earth for the redeemed. See Revelation 21:1.


<b>SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTâS CLAIM<b>

Seventh-day Adventists claim to be people of the Bible and reject various beliefs held by other religious groups, such as the Roman Catholic Church's practices, Joseph Smith's Book of Mormon, Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health with Keys to Scripture, and the Jehovahâs Witnesses' teachings, as they believe these cannot be supported by the Bible. However, they accept Ellen White's additions to the Bible and her contradictions without question, which may appear contradictory to their claim of adhering strictly to Scripture.

<b>HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?<b>

The Seventh-day Adventist Church justifies this by stating that Ellen G. White's writings were not intended to be an addition to the biblical canon. Instead, they view her as a prophet to the Church, similar to the prophets of the Bible. They argue that her messages should be received in the same way as the messages of the biblical prophets, even though her writings are not considered part of the Bible.

<b>Did E.G. White claim infallibility for the Testimonies? Yes.<b>

E.G. White asserted that her testimonies were not merely her own opinions but were messages from God. She admonished readers not to question or diminish their confidence in these testimonies, equating it to rebelling against God. She believed that her writings were inspired by the Spirit of God and should be treated as such.

<b>A Request to the Readers of This Paper<b>

<h2>Test #2 : Doctrinal Harmony
   - <b>Criteria:<b> A later prophet must not contradict earlier prophets; the Holy Spirit never contradicts His previously given testimony, for God does not change like shifting shadows.
   - <b>Biblical Reference:<b> James 1:17

In the context of the Seventh-day Adventist faith, doctrinal harmony is a fundamental principle that guides their interpretation of prophetic messages, especially those from later prophets like Ellen G. White. This principle is based on the belief that God's messages to His people should maintain consistency and harmony throughout time.

<b>Criteria for Doctrinal Harmony:<b>
Seventh-day Adventists uphold the principle that a later prophet's messages should not contradict those of earlier prophets. In other words, the messages delivered by prophets throughout history, including the contemporary prophets like Ellen G. White, must align with the teachings and revelations of their predecessors. This consistency ensures that the Holy Spirit, who inspires these messages, never contradicts His previously given testimony.

This principle reflects the belief that God's character and His truths are unchanging, and His revelation to humanity should maintain a cohesive and harmonious message throughout history.

<b>Biblical Reference - James 1:17:<b>
The foundation of this principle can be found in the Bible, particularly in James 1:17: "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows." This verse emphasizes the unchanging nature of God and the consistency of His gifts and revelations.

For Seventh-day Adventists, this biblical reference underscores the importance of doctrinal harmony and the need for later prophets to align their messages with the unchanging truths previously revealed by God.

Ellen G. White's 1847 letter to Joseph Bates sheds light on historical aspects of the Seventh-day Adventist movement, particularly concerning the "shut door" doctrine. This letter, previously hidden, provides insights into Ellen G. White's beliefs and her interaction with other prominent figures in the early Adventist community. The letter is significant in understanding the development of Adventist theology during that period.

<b>History of the Secret Bates' 1847 Letter:<b>
The complete Bates letter had been hidden from the members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with only non-damaging portions available until 1980 when the complete letter was finally uncovered. Adventist leaders had access to this letter, which showed Ellen G. White's belief in the "shut door" doctrine after 1845. This was significant because Ellen G. White was accused of believing in the "shut door" doctrine through visions.

<b>Examples of Deception:<b>
The letter highlights instances where Ellen G. White's teachings and actions appeared to contradict her later public stance. It references Francis D. Nichol's book, "Ellen G. White and Her Critics," which suggests that Ellen G. White was aware of her belief in the "shut door" doctrine but did not openly acknowledge it in her later writings.

<b>The Secret Letter:<b>
The 1984 Adventists Currents article by Skip Baker further discusses the discovery of the letter. It reveals that Ellen G. White had knowledge of the "shut door" doctrine, as she discussed it with Joseph Bates. This contradicts the notion that her beliefs were solely based on divine visions.

<b>Breaking the Code - Understanding What Ellen White Was Saying to Joseph Bates:<b>
Skip Baker's analysis dissects Ellen G. White's letter point by point, showing that Ellen White was well aware of the "shut door" doctrine and that her "visions" confirmed this belief. The letter indicates that she had knowledge of this doctrine from sources other than divine revelation.

This historical context sheds light on the early development of Adventist theology and the complexities surrounding Ellen G. White's teachings and beliefs.

The images referenced in the article provide visual context to the historical documents discussed. These images contribute to a deeper understanding of the letter's content and its significance in the Adventist movement's history.

It is essential to consider these historical documents when discussing Ellen G. White's role in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the development of Adventist beliefs.
