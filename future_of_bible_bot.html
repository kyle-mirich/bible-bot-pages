    <h3>
     <strong>
      Understanding the Token-Based System:
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     Bible Bot operates on a token-based system, a method where each interaction with the bot consumes a certain number of "tokens." Think of tokens as units of computation that translate into a cost. This transparent and straightforward approach ensures that you know exactly what you're paying for. Here's how it breaks down:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Input: $0.03 / 1K tokens
     </li>
     <li>
      Output: $0.06 / 1K tokens
     </li>
     <li>
      Average Tokens per Question: 500
     </li>
     <li>
      Average Questions per User (Per Day): 5
     </li>
     <li>
      Average Cost Per User (Per Day): $0.45
     </li>
     <li>
      Total Daily Cost for 10,000 Users: $4,500
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     This pricing model ensures accessibility and transparency, without compromising quality or depth.
    </p>
