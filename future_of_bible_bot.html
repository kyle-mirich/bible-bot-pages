     Bible Bot : A New Era in Biblical Engagement
    </h2>
    <p>
     I'm excited to introduce Bible Bot! This isn't just an application; it's a revolution that has the potential to transform how churches, pastors, scholars, and individuals engage with the Bible.
    </p>
    <h3>
     <strong>
      The Power of Questions and Answers:
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     Bible Bot offers the ability to ask questions about the Bible and receive answers in real-time. It's like having a personal Bible scholar at your fingertips. Whether you're exploring theological concepts or seeking insights into a specific verse, Bible Bot is here to guide you.
    </p>
    <h3>
     <strong>
      Revolutionizing Bible Translations (In Development):
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     The ability to create Bible translations in any style, in any language, in seconds, is currently in development. Soon, you'll be able to experience the AI Gospel of John as a demo right here on this page. This groundbreaking technology has the potential to make the Word of God accessible to all, breaking down linguistic and cultural barriers.

    <h3>
     <strong>
      Understanding the Token-Based System:
     </strong>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Bible Bot operates on a token-based system. You can think of tokens as little virtual tickets; each interaction with the bot uses some of these tickets. The more complex your request, the more tickets are used. It's like paying for a bus ride: the longer the journey, the more tickets you need. This simple approach ensures that you know exactly what you're paying for. Here's how it breaks down:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Input (sending a question to the bot): $0.03 per 1,000 tokens
        </li>
        <li>
            Output (receiving an answer from the bot): $0.06 per 1,000 tokens
        </li>
        <li>
            Average Tokens per Question (both sending and receiving): 500
        </li>
        <li>
            Average Questions per User (Per Day): 10
        </li>
        <li>
            Average Cost Per User (Per Day): $0.45
        </li>
        <li>
            Total Daily Cost per 1,000 Users: $450
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        This pricing model ensures accessibility and transparency, without compromising quality or depth.
        </p>
