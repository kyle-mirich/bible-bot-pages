    </h2>
    <p>
     I'm excited to introduce Bible Bot! This isn't just an application; it's a revolution that has the potential to transform how churches, pastors, scholars, and individuals engage with the Bible.
    </p>
    <h3>
     <strong>
      The Power of Questions and Answers:

    </p>
    <h3>
     <strong>
      Revolutionizing Bible Translations (In Development):
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
    The ability to create Bible translations in any style, in any language, in seconds, is here! Experience the AI Gospel of John <a href="https://ai-gospel-of-john.streamlit.app/">here</a>. This groundbreaking technology has the potential to make the Word of God accessible to all, breaking down linguistic and cultural barriers.
    </p>
    <h3>
     <strong>
      Understanding the Token-Based System:
     </strong>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Bible Bot operates on a token-based system. You can think of tokens as little virtual tickets; each interaction with the bot uses some of these tickets. The more complex your request, the more tickets are used. It's like paying for a bus ride: the longer the journey, the more tickets you need. This simple approach ensures that you know exactly what you're paying for. Here's how it breaks down:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <h3><strong>The Token-Based System:</strong></h3>
            <div class="token-list" >
                <div class="token-item">
                    <strong>Input:</strong> <span>$0.03 per 1,000 tokens</span>
                </div>
                <div class="token-item">
                    <strong>Output:</strong> <span>$0.06 per 1,000 tokens</span>
                </div>
            </div>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Average Tokens per Question (both sending and receiving): 500
        </li>
        <li>
            Average Questions per User (Per Day): 10
        </li>
        <li>
            Average Cost Per User (Per Day): $0.45
        </li>
        <li>
            Total Daily Cost per 1,000 Users: $450
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The bonuses of the token pricing model is that it is very transparent. You can see to the dollar how much it costs to run for the entire day, month, year, etc. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The issue is that I do not have much data on what the average cost is, since the app has not gone out to users, it's difficult to say what the average token number or cost is.
            </li>
            <li>
                The good news is that AI technology is getting cheaper and cheaper to run almost every few months. This means this price will most likely only decrease!
